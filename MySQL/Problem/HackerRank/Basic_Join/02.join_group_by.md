## Problem

You are given two tables: Students and Grades. Students contains three columns ID, Name and Marks.

Ketty gives Eve a task to generate a report containing three columns: Name, Grade and Mark. Ketty doesn't want the `NAMES` of those students who received a grade lower than 8. The report must be in descending order by grade -- i.e. higher grades are entered first. If there is more than one student with the same grade (8-10) assigned to them, order those particular students by their name alphabetically. Finally, if the grade is lower than 8, use "NULL" as their name and list them by their grades in descending order. If there is more than one student with the same grade (1-7) assigned to them, order those particular students by their marks in ascending order.

The CITY and COUNTRY tables are described as follows:

## Solution

```sql

SELECT
    CASE
        WHEN grade >= 8 THEN name
        WHEN grade < 8 THEN 'NULL'
    END AS studentName,
    g.grade,
    s.marks
FROM Students s
JOIN Grades g ON s.marks BETWEEN g.min_mark AND g.max_mark
ORDER BY g.grade DESC, name ASC;

```

## Explanation

Select start with name condition like if the students grade is greater than or equal to `8` then name will be shown else `NULL`.
Now comes to the join, it's an conditional joining with lower and upper value of `g.min_mark` and `g.max_mark`. But the most trick part is `order by`.
when sort by grade will make the name with null field down where `grade < 8` .
