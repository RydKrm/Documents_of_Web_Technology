## Delete Operations

When deleting a record, the deleted value needs to have primary key or it will trigger a Batch Delete

```go
db.Delete(&email)
// delete from email where id = 10
```

### Delete with primary key

GORM allows to delete objects using primary key(s) with inline condition, it works with numbers

```go
db.Delete(&User{}, 10)
// DELETE FROM users WHERE id = 10;

db.Delete(&User{}, "10")
// DELETE FROM users WHERE id = 10;

db.Delete(&users, []int{1,2,3})
// DELETE FROM users WHERE id IN (1,2,3);

```

### Delete Hook

`GORM` allows hooks `BeforeDelete`, `AfterDelete`, those methods will be called when deleting a record, refer Hooks for details

```go
func (u *User) BeforeDelete(tx *gorm.DB) (err error) {
  if u.Role == "admin" {
    return errors.New("admin user not allowed to delete")
  }
  return
}
```
