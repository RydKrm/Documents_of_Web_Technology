/* 
  * polymorphism refers to the ability of objects to be treated as instances of their parent 
*  class or interface, allowing methods to be invoked on them even if they belong to  
* different concrete implementations. This enables flexibility and code reusability by  
* allowing different objects to be used interchangeably in code that expects a common interface.

* Polymorphism in JavaScript is primarily achieved through prototype-based inheritance and 
* duck typing. Objects can share behavior through their prototype chain, and methods can be 
* invoked on objects regardless of their specific type as long as they implement the expected interface.
