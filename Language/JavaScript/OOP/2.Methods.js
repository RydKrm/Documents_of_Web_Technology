/* 
 * 
* In JavaScript, findOdd and findOdd() are different entities:

* findOdd:
* This is a function declaration. When you write const findOdd = ..., you are declaring a 
* function named findOdd and assigning it a value. However, the function is not executed at 
* this point; it is simply defined. You can think of findOdd as a reference to the function.
* findOdd():
* This is a function call. When you write findOdd(), you are actually invoking/calling the * function named findOdd. This executes the code inside the function body.
* So, findOdd is a reference to the function, while findOdd() is the actual execution of the function.
