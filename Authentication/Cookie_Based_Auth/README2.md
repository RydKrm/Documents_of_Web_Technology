# Difference between cookie base auth and session based auth

### Definition

- **Cookie-Based Authentication:** In this method, the server sends an authentication token (usually a session ID or JWT) to the client as a cookie upon successful login. The cookie is stored in the client's browser and sent with each request to the server.

- **Session-Based Authentication:** This method involves the server creating a session for a user after they log in. The session ID is stored on the server, and the client receives a session ID cookie. The server uses this ID to track the user's session state.

### Data Storage

- **Cookie-Based Authentication:** The client holds the authentication token (like a JWT) in the cookie. This token often contains user information and can be self-contained, allowing the server to validate the token without needing to store session data.

- **Session-Based Authentication:** The session data is stored on the server side, typically in memory, a database, or a session store. The client only holds the session ID in a cookie.

### State Management

- **Cookie-Based Authentication:** Often stateless, meaning the server does not need to retain session state between requests. This is common with JWTs, where the token contains all the necessary information.

- **Session-Based Authentication:** Statefulness is maintained on the server. The server tracks the user's session and can store various data related to that session, such as user roles or permissions.

### Security

- **Cookie-Based Authentication:** Security can be enhanced with techniques like signing the JWT and using attributes like HttpOnly, Secure, and SameSite for cookies. However, because the token may contain sensitive information, it's crucial to secure it properly.

- **Session-Based Authentication:** Generally considered more secure against certain attacks (like XSS) since sensitive information remains on the server. However, it can be susceptible to session fixation and session hijacking if not implemented correctly.

### Use Cases

- **Cookie-Based Authentication:** Often used in APIs, Single Page Applications (SPAs), and scenarios where stateless authentication is beneficial.

- **Session-Based Authentication:** Commonly used in traditional web applications where maintaining user state is necessary.
