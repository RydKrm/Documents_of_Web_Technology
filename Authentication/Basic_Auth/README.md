### Basic Authentication Overview

Basic Authentication is a simple authentication scheme built into the HTTP protocol. In this method, the client sends the username and password in the Authorization header of the HTTP request, encoded using Base64.

### step-by-step breakdown of how it works:

1. Client Request

- The client makes a request to a server endpoint that requires authentication.
- The request header includes an Authorization field with the word Basic followed by a Base64-encoded string of username:password.

2. Server Response

- The server decodes the Base64 string to extract the username and password.
- It checks the credentials against its stored data (typically in a database).
- If the credentials are valid, the server grants access.
- If not, it returns a 401 Unauthorized status.

3. Security Concerns

- Base64 encoding is not encryption; it's just an encoding scheme, meaning the credentials can be easily decoded.
- It is recommended to use Basic Authentication over HTTPS to prevent credentials from being intercepted during transmission

5. Advantages

- Simple and easy to implement.
- Widely supported by browsers and HTTP clients.

6. Disadvantages

- Credentials are transmitted with every request, making it vulnerable to interception without HTTPS.
- Requires secure storage of credentials on the server.
- No mechanism to log out users or expire credentials.
