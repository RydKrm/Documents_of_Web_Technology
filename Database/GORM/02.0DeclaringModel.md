### Declaring Models

Models are defined using normal structs. These structs can contain fields with basic Go types, pointers or aliases of these types, or even custom
types,

```go
type User struct {
  ID           uint           // Standard field for the primary key which is auto increment
  Name         string         // A regular string field , can not hold a nil value
  Email        *string        // A pointer to a string, allowing for nil values
  Age          uint8          // An unsigned 8-bit integer
  Birthday     *time.Time     // A pointer to time.Time, can be null
  MemberNumber sql.NullString // Uses sql.NullString to handle nullable strings
  ActivatedAt  sql.NullTime   // Uses sql.NullTime for nullable time fields
  CreatedAt    time.Time      // Automatically managed by GORM for creation time
  UpdatedAt    time.Time      // Automatically managed by GORM for update time
}
```

### Conventions

**Primary Key:** GORM uses a field named ID as the default primary key for each model.
**Table Names:** By default, GORM converts struct names to snake_case and pluralizes them for table names. For instance, a User struct becomes users in the database.
**Column Names:** GORM automatically converts struct field names to snake_case for column names in the database.
**Timestamp Fields:** GORM uses fields named CreatedAt and UpdatedAt to automatically track the creation and update times of records.

### Embedded Struct

Gorm `ID`, `CreateAt`, `UpdatedAt` these field can be added by only on line of code

```go
type User struct {
  gorm.Model
  Name string
}
// equals
type User struct {
  ID        uint           `gorm:"primaryKey"`
  CreatedAt time.Time
  UpdatedAt time.Time
  DeletedAt gorm.DeletedAt `gorm:"index"`
  Name string
}
```

Also for embedding two struct together

```go
type Author struct {
  Name  string
  Email string
}

type Blog struct {
  ID      int
  Author  Author `gorm:"embedded"`
  Upvotes int32
}
```

Which is equals to this embedding

```go
type Blog struct {
  ID    int64
  Name  string
  Email string
  Upvotes  int32
}
```

Embedded field name can be prefix by other name

```go
type Blog struct {
  ID      int
  Author  Author `gorm:"embedded;embeddedPrefix:author_"`
  Upvotes int32
}
```

This embedded prefix will be added with `author_` name with every column of author

```go
type Blog struct {
  ID          int64
  AuthorName  string
  AuthorEmail string
  Upvotes     int32
}

```

### Field Tags

Those are optional which is used for giving different property. Those are case sensitive and camal case is preferred. Multiple tag can be used by `;` separator

| Tag Name        | Description                                |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| type            | int, bool,uint, float, string, time,byte   |
| size            | data size                                  |
| primaryKey      | define the primary key                     |
| unique          | make a column unique                       |
| default         | set the default value                      |
| not null        | this field require                         |
| autoincrement   | make a field data auto increment           |
| index           | create index with option                   |
| embedded        | marge two struct                           |
| embedded_prefix | while merge two struct added a prefix name |
