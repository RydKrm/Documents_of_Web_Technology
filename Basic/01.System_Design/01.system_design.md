## System Design

System design is the process of defining the architecture, components, modules, interfaces, and data for a system to satisfy specified requirements. In the context of software engineering, it focuses on creating a blueprint for building scalable, maintainable, and efficient software systems.

## ðŸ”§ Types of System Design
### High-Level Design (HLD):
- Focuses on overall architecture
- Defines modules, data flow, system interfaces
- Examples: Microservices vs. monolithic, REST APIs, database types (SQL vs. NoSQL)

### Low-Level Design (LLD):
- Focuses on detailed implementation
- Includes class diagrams, function definitions, algorithms, and database schema

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Components of System Design
- Scalability: Can the system handle increased load?
- Availability: Is the system reliably accessible?
- Latency & Performance: How fast does it respond to user requests?
- Fault Tolerance: Can it handle failures gracefully?
- Security: How is data protected from unauthorized access?
- Maintainability: How easy is it to fix bugs or add features?

| Impact Area         | Effect of Good System Design        | Effect of Poor System Design                  |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Performance**     | Fast and responsive systems         | Sluggish or unresponsive apps                 |
| **Scalability**     | Easily handles more users or data   | Breaks under high load                        |
| **Reliability**     | Few outages or crashes              | Frequent downtime                             |
| **Maintainability** | Easier to debug, update, and extend | Fragile and hard to update                    |
| **Cost**            | Efficient use of resources          | High cloud/server costs due to inefficiencies |
| **User Experience** | Smooth and consistent interactions  | Frustrating or buggy experiences              |

#### ðŸ§  Example Scenario
Imagine you're designing an Instagram-like app.

### System Design Considerations:
- How do you store and retrieve millions of images?
- How do you deliver them with low latency?
- How do you ensure users can like, comment, or follow in real-time?


System design answers these questions with a combination of databases, caching strategies (like Redis), CDNs, load balancers, and well-structured APIs.
