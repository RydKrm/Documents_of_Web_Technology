## 🔽 Low-Level System Design (LLD) – Explained Simply
Low-Level Design (LLD) is the detailed blueprint of how each part of a system will be implemented. While HLD focuses on the architecture and components, LLD dives into the internal structure, like classes, functions, database schema, and algorithms.

### ✅ What It Includes
- Class diagrams and relationships (e.g., User, Product, Order)
- Function signatures and their responsibilities
- Database schema and relations (ER diagrams)
- API endpoints and request/response structure
- Design patterns (e.g., Singleton, Repository, Factory)
- Data validation, error handling, input/output formats

### 👨‍💻 Who Does LLD
- Software engineers
- Backend/frontend developers
- Tech leads (for review and architecture guidance)

### They use the high-level plan and break it down into implementable units of work.

### 🛒 Example: E-Commerce App – LLD for Order System
Let’s focus on just the order placement flow. 

###🧱 Class Design (simplified):

```typescript
class Order {
  id: string;
  userId: string;
  productList: Product[];
  totalAmount: number;
  paymentStatus: 'pending' | 'completed' | 'failed';
  
  createOrder(): void
  calculateTotal(): number
  updatePaymentStatus(status: string): void
}
```

### 🌐 API Design:
Endpoint: POST /orders
Request:

```typescript
{
  "userId": "123",
  "products": [
    { "productId": "p1", "quantity": 2 },
    { "productId": "p2", "quantity": 1 }
  ],
  "paymentMethod": "card"
}
```

Response:

```typescript
{
  "orderId": "123",
  "totalAmount": 100,
  "paymentStatus": "pending"
}
```

### 🧾 Database Schema (simplified):

```typescript
users
- id (PK)
- name
- email

orders
- id (PK)
- user_id (FK)
- total_amount
- payment_status

order_items
- id (PK)
- order_id (FK)
- product_id (FK)
- quantity
```

### 🧠 Summary: HLD vs. LLD

| Feature           | High-Level Design (HLD)    | Low-Level Design (LLD)                   |
| ----------------- | -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Focus             | Architecture & interaction | Code structure & logic                   |
| Abstraction level | High                       | Detailed                                 |
| Audience          | Architects, leads          | Developers                               |
| Output            | Diagrams, tech stack       | Class diagrams, DB schema, APIs, methods |
