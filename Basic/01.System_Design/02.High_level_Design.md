## 🔷 High-Level System Design (HLD) – Brief Explanation
High-Level System Design is the architectural overview of a system. It outlines how different parts of a system interact at a broad level without going into code or technical specifics.

### ✅ What It Includes
- Main components/modules (e.g., frontend, backend, database)
- How components communicate (e.g., REST API, gRPC, message queue)
- Data flow (e.g., how a request travels through the system)
- Technology choices (e.g., Node.js for backend, PostgreSQL for DB)
- External systems/integrations (e.g., payment gateway, CDN)

### 👨‍💻 Who Does HLD
- System architects
- Senior software engineers
- Tech leads

These roles design the architecture before development begins, often in collaboration with DevOps and product managers.

### 📦 Example: E-Commerce Web App – HLD
Let’s say you’re building an Amazon-like e-commerce app.

#### 🧱 Components:
- Frontend: React.js (UI)
- Backend API: Node.js/NestJS
- Database: PostgreSQL (products, orders)
- Authentication: OAuth + JWT
- Cache: Redis (to cache product pages)
- Search Engine: Elasticsearch
- Payment Service: Stripe or bKash
- Object Storage: AWS S3 (for product images)
- CDN: Cloudflare (for faster image delivery)

#### 🛠️ Flow:
- User opens the product page → frontend calls backend API
- Backend fetches data from cache → if not found, fetch from DB
- Images are loaded from S3 via CDN
- User adds to cart → backend stores cart info
- User pays → backend contacts Stripe
- Order is stored in DB and confirmation sent
