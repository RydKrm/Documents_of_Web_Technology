The **OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model** is a 7-layer framework that standardizes network communication. Each layer has a specific function, ensuring seamless data transfer between devices. Below is a brief explanation of each layer, with a focus on the **Network Layer (Layer 3)**.

---

### **1. Physical Layer (Layer 1)**
- **Function:** Transmits raw bits (0s and 1s) over a physical medium (cables, Wi-Fi).
- **Devices:** Hubs, Repeaters, Modems.
- **Protocols/Standards:** Ethernet (IEEE 802.3), USB, Bluetooth.

---

### **2. Data Link Layer (Layer 2)**
- **Function:** Ensures error-free data transfer between directly connected nodes.
- **Sub-layers:**
  - **MAC (Media Access Control):** Controls hardware addressing (MAC addresses).
  - **LLC (Logical Link Control):** Manages flow control and error checking.
- **Devices:** Switches, Bridges.
- **Protocols:** Ethernet (IEEE 802.3), PPP, ARP.

---

### **3. Network Layer (Layer 3) – Core Focus**
- **Function:** Routes data packets between different networks (logical addressing, path determination).
- **Key Tasks:**
  - **Logical Addressing:** Uses IP addresses (IPv4/IPv6) to identify devices.
  - **Routing:** Determines the best path for data (using routers).
  - **Fragmentation:** Breaks large packets into smaller ones if needed.
- **Devices:** Routers, Layer 3 Switches.
- **Protocols:** IP (Internet Protocol), ICMP, RIP, OSPF, BGP.

---

### **4. Transport Layer (Layer 4)**
- **Function:** Ensures end-to-end data delivery (reliability, flow control, error correction).
- **Protocols:**
  - **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol):** Connection-oriented (reliable).
  - **UDP (User Datagram Protocol):** Connectionless (fast, no error recovery).

---

### **5. Session Layer (Layer 5)**
- **Function:** Manages connections (sessions) between applications.
- **Tasks:** Establishes, maintains, and terminates sessions.
- **Protocols:** NetBIOS, RPC, SIP.

---

### **6. Presentation Layer (Layer 6)**
- **Function:** Translates data into a usable format (encryption, compression, encoding).
- **Examples:** SSL/TLS (encryption), JPEG/MPEG (compression).

---

### **7. Application Layer (Layer 7)**
- **Function:** Provides interfaces for end-user applications.
- **Protocols/Services:** HTTP, FTP, SMTP, DNS, DHCP.

---

### **Network Layer (Layer 3) Deep Dive**
- **Why It Matters:**  
  - Enables communication between devices across different networks (e.g., LAN to WAN).  
  - Uses **routers** to forward packets based on IP addresses.  
- **Example:** When you visit a website, the Network Layer routes your request through multiple routers to reach the server.

---

### **Summary**
- **Lower Layers (1–3):** Deal with physical connectivity, addressing, and routing.  
- **Upper Layers (4–7):** Handle end-to-end communication, data formatting, and user applications.  
- **Network Layer (Layer 3)** is crucial for **inter-network communication** using IP and routing protocols.
