## 🔹 What is a Fanout Exchange?

Broadcasts messages to all bound queues (ignores routing keys).
1:N relationship – Every queue bound to the exchange gets a copy.
Best for: Event notifications (e.g., live updates, news alerts).

### 🔧 How It Works

Producer sends a message to the exchange (routing key is ignored).
Exchange delivers a copy to every bound queue.
All consumers receive the message (if subscribed to a bound queue).

## 📌 Example Scenario

Exchange: news_updates (type: fanout)
Queues:

```
email_notifications
sms_notifications
logging_service
```

### 1️⃣ Producer (producer.js)

```javascript
const amqp = require("amqplib");

async function broadcastNews() {
  const connection = await amqp.connect("amqp://localhost");
  const channel = await connection.createChannel();

  const exchangeName = "news_updates";
  await channel.assertExchange(exchangeName, "fanout", { durable: false });

  // Send a news update (routing key is empty)
  channel.publish(
    exchangeName,
    "",
    Buffer.from("Breaking: RabbitMQ 4.0 released!")
  );
  console.log("📢 News broadcasted to all queues!");

  setTimeout(() => connection.close(), 500);
}

broadcastNews();
```

### 2️⃣ Consumer (consumer.js)

```javascript
const amqp = require("amqplib");

async function createFanoutSubscribers() {
  const connection = await amqp.connect("amqp://localhost");
  const channel = await connection.createChannel();

  const exchangeName = "news_updates";
  await channel.assertExchange(exchangeName, "fanout", { durable: false });

  // Create 3 different queues bound to the same fanout exchange
  const queues = [
    { name: "email_notifications", service: "📧 Email Service" },
    { name: "sms_notifications", service: "📱 SMS Service" },
    { name: "logging_service", service: "📝 Logging Service" },
  ];

  // Bind and consume for each queue
  for (const queue of queues) {
    await channel.assertQueue(queue.name, { durable: false });
    await channel.bindQueue(queue.name, exchangeName, ""); // Empty routing key

    channel.consume(queue.name, (msg) => {
      if (msg) {
        console.log(`${queue.service} received: ${msg.content.toString()}`);
        channel.ack(msg);
      }
    });

    console.log(`${queue.service} waiting for messages...`);
  }
}

createFanoutSubscribers();
```

### 📊 Expected Output

##### Expected Output When Running with Producer:

```javascript
📧 Email Service waiting for messages...
Breaking: RabbitMQ 4.0 released!
```

##### When the producer sends a message:

```javascript
📧 Email Service received: Breaking: RabbitMQ 4.0 released!
📱 SMS Service received: Breaking: RabbitMQ 4.0 released!
📝 Logging Service received: Breaking: RabbitMQ 4.0 released!
```

### 🎯 Key Takeaways

✔ Fanout = "Broadcast mode" (no routing keys, no filtering).
✔ Every bound queue gets a copy of the message.
✔ Use cases:

Real-time notifications (e.g., stock price updates).
Multi-service logging.
Event-driven architectures.

### Important Notes:

- No Routing Keys: All queues receive all messages (fanout behavior)
- Durable Queues: Set durable: true if you want messages to survive broker restarts
- Exclusive Queues: Removed exclusive: true to allow multiple consumers per queue
