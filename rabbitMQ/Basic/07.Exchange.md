# RabbitMQ: Exchanges, Queues, and Routing Keys

## What is an Exchange?

An **exchange** in RabbitMQ acts as a message router. It receives messages from producers and decides which queues they should be delivered to based on:

- **Exchange type** (direct, topic, fanout, headers)
- **Routing key** (message's "address tag")
- **Bindings** (rules connecting exchanges to queues)

## How an Exchange Works

1. **Producer** sends a message → **Exchange**
2. Exchange evaluates:
   - Routing key
   - Binding rules
   - Exchange type
3. Message is routed to appropriate **queue(s)**
4. **Consumer** reads from queue

## Exchange Types

| Type      | Behavior                       | Use Case                     |
| --------- | ------------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| `direct`  | Exact routing key match        | Order processing systems     |
| `topic`   | Wildcard matching (`*`, `#`)   | Logging systems              |
| `fanout`  | Broadcast to all bound queues  | News updates                 |
| `headers` | Match based on message headers | Complex routing requirements |

## Queue vs Routing Key

| Component       | Purpose                       | Analogous to... |
| --------------- | ----------------------------- | --------------- |
| **Queue**       | Stores messages for consumers | Mailbox         |
| **Routing Key** | Message "address" for routing | Postal ZIP code |

## Example: Direct Exchange

```python
# Pseudocode example
channel.exchange_declare("orders", "direct")
channel.queue_declare("payments")
channel.queue_declare("shipments")

# Bind queues to exchange with routing keys
channel.queue_bind("payments", "orders", "payment")
channel.queue_bind("shipments", "orders", "shipment")

# Publishing
channel.publish("orders", "payment", "Payment processed")  # → payments queue
channel.publish("orders", "shipment", "Order shipped")     # → shipments queue
```

```text
[Producer]
    ↓ (message + routing_key)
[Exchange] (type=direct)
    ├── [payments] (bound to "payment")
    └── [shipments] (bound to "shipment")
```

## Key Takeaways

Exchanges are message routers
Routing keys determine message destination
Queues are message storage endpoints
Bindings connect exchanges to queues
