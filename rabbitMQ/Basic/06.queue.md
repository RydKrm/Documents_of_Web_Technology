## 📦 What is a Queue in RabbitMQ?

A Queue is a storage buffer in RabbitMQ where messages are held until consumed.
Messages sit in the queue until a consumer reads and processes them.
Think of it like a waiting line for tasks.

### 🧱 Key Features

| Feature           | Description                                                         |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 📥 FIFO           | Queues follow **First In, First Out** (unless priorities are used). |
| 🛑 Durable        | You can make queues survive server restarts (`durable: true`).      |
| 🕒 Temporary      | You can create auto-deleting or exclusive queues for short tasks.   |
| 📤 Message Buffer | Stores messages even if the consumer is offline.                    |

### 🔁 Flow in RabbitMQ

```css
[ Producer ] → [ Exchange ] → 🎯 [ Queue ] → [ Consumer ]
```

### 🎯 Real Example

You publish an email task to RabbitMQ.
The message is routed to emailQueue.
The message stays there until the email service (consumer) picks it up.
Once processed, RabbitMQ removes it from the queue.

### 🧪 Sample Queue Code (Node.js)

```js
const queue = "emailQueue";
await channel.assertQueue(queue, { durable: true });
channel.sendToQueue(queue, Buffer.from("Send welcome email"));
```

### ✅ Summary

- A queue holds messages temporarily.
- It acts as a decoupling point between producers and consumers.
- Ensures reliability even if consumers are down.
