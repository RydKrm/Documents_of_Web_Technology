## 🧩 What is Decoupling?

Decoupling means separating components so they work independently instead of relying directly on each other.

Instead of:

```css
[ Service A ] → calls → [ Service B ]
```

You use:

```css
[ Service A ] → sends message → [ Queue ] → [ Service B ]
```

### ✅ Benefits of Decoupling

### Benefit Description

| Benefit                   | Description                                               |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🔄 **Flexibility**        | Services can be updated or replaced independently.        |
| 🛠 **Easier Maintenance**  | Bugs in one part don’t directly affect others.            |
| ⚖️ **Scalability**        | You can scale services independently based on demand.     |
| 🔁 **Retry & Resilience** | Messages can be retried if a service is temporarily down. |
| 🔕 **Isolation**          | One service crashing doesn’t crash the whole system.      |
| 🚀 **Faster Development** | Teams can work on different services at the same time.    |

### 🧠 Real Example

Without Decoupling:
OrderService calls EmailService directly → if email service is down, order fails.
With Decoupling (RabbitMQ):
OrderService sends message to queue → continues
EmailService processes it when available → more reliable
