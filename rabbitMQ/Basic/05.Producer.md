## 🛠️ What is a Producer in RabbitMQ?

A Producer is any application or service that sends messages to RabbitMQ.
It doesn’t send directly to queues.
Instead, it sends messages to an Exchange.
The exchange then routes the message to one or more queues based on rules.

## 🔁 Flow Example

```text
[ Producer ] → [ Exchange ] → [ Queue ] → [ Consumer ]
```

### 🎯 What Does a Producer Do?

Connects to RabbitMQ.
Declares (or ensures) an exchange or queue exists.
Sends a message (like text, JSON, etc.).
Optionally sets message properties (headers, priority, etc.).

### 🧠 Real Example: Email Producer

Sends:
{ "type": "email", "to": "john@example.com", "subject": "Welcome!" }
Exchange receives it → routes to emailQueue
Later, a consumer will read and send the email

### 🧪 Sample Producer Code (Node.js)

```js
const amqp = require("amqplib");

async function sendMessage() {
  const connection = await amqp.connect("amqp://localhost");
  const channel = await connection.createChannel();

  const queue = "emailQueue";
  const msg = "Send welcome email to john@example.com";

  await channel.assertQueue(queue, { durable: true });
  channel.sendToQueue(queue, Buffer.from(msg));

  console.log("Sent:", msg);

  setTimeout(() => connection.close(), 500);
}

sendMessage();
```

### ✅ Summary

- A producer sends messages to RabbitMQ.
- It connects to an exchange or queue.
- It never knows who will consume the message.
- It allows asynchronous, decoupled communication.
