## 🔹 What is a Direct Exchange?

Routes messages to queues based on an exact match of the routing key.
1:1 relationship between routing key and queue (unless multiple queues use the same key).
Best for: Task distribution (e.g., sending payments to a payments queue, shipments to a shipments queue).

### 🔧 How It Works

- Producer sends a message with a routing key (e.g., "payment").
- Exchange checks bindings and forwards the message only to queues bound with that exact key.
- Consumer receives messages from its subscribed queue.

### 📌 Example Scenario

- Exchange: orders_exchange (type: direct)
- Queues:
  payments_queue (bound to key "payment")
  shipments_queue (bound to key "shipment")

### 1️⃣ Producer (producer.js)

```javascript
const amqp = require("amqplib");

async function sendMessage() {
  const connection = await amqp.connect("amqp://localhost");
  const channel = await connection.createChannel();

  const exchangeName = "orders_exchange";
  await channel.assertExchange(exchangeName, "direct", { durable: true });

  // Send a payment message
  channel.publish(
    exchangeName,
    "payment", // Routing key
    Buffer.from("Payment processed for order #123")
  );
  console.log("✅ Sent payment message");

  // Send a shipment message
  channel.publish(
    exchangeName,
    "shipment", // Routing key
    Buffer.from("Order #123 shipped")
  );
  console.log("✅ Sent shipment message");

  setTimeout(() => connection.close(), 500);
}

sendMessage();
```

Here is the overview of channel, exchange, and queues relations:

```javascript
                                         channel
                                            |
                                            |
                                            |
                                          Exchange
                                /                        \
                               /                          \
                             /                             \
                            /                               \
                           /                                 \
                         /                                    \
                       /                                       \
                      /                                         \
payments(route_key: payment) → payments_queue      shipments(route_key: shipment) → shipments_queue
```

### Consumer

```javascript
const amqp = require("amqplib");

async function receiveMessages() {
  const connection = await amqp.connect("amqp://localhost");
  const channel = await connection.createChannel();

  const exchangeName = "orders_exchange";
  await channel.assertExchange(exchangeName, "direct", { durable: true });

  // Set up payments queue
  const paymentsQueue = "payments_queue";
  await channel.assertQueue(paymentsQueue, { durable: true });
  await channel.bindQueue(paymentsQueue, exchangeName, "payment");

  // Set up shipments queue
  const shipmentsQueue = "shipments_queue";
  await channel.assertQueue(shipmentsQueue, { durable: true });
  await channel.bindQueue(shipmentsQueue, exchangeName, "shipment");

  console.log("⌛ Waiting for messages...");

  // Consume payments
  channel.consume(paymentsQueue, (msg) => {
    if (msg) {
      console.log(`💰 [PAYMENTS] ${msg.content.toString()}`);
      channel.ack(msg);
    }
  });

  // Consume shipments
  channel.consume(shipmentsQueue, (msg) => {
    if (msg) {
      console.log(`🚚 [SHIPMENTS] ${msg.content.toString()}`);
      channel.ack(msg);
    }
  });
}

receiveMessages();
```

## Consumer's Relationship

Here is the overview of channel, exchange, and queues relations:

```javascript
                                         channel
                                            |
                                            |
                                            |
                                          Exchange

                                /                        \
                               /                          \
                         (payments_queue)               (shipments_queue)
                            /                               \
                           /                                 \
                         /                                    \
                       /                                       \
                      /                                         \
  consume -> payments_queue(route_key: payment)      shipments_queue(route_key: shipment)

```

### 📊 Expected Output

When Running producer.js
✅ Sent payment message  
✅ Sent shipment message  
When Running consumer.js

```javascript

⌛ Waiting for messages...
💰 [PAYMENTS] Payment processed for order #123
🚚 [SHIPMENTS] Order #123 shipped
```

### 🔍 How Messages Are Routed

Routing Key Queue That Receives It

```javascript
"payment" → payments_queue
"shipment" → shipments_queue
```

If a message has a key not bound to any queue, it is discarded.
If multiple queues bind to the same key, they all get the message (like fanout for that key).

### 🎯 Key Takeaways

✔ Direct exchanges route strictly by exact routing key matches.
✔ Perfect for separating different types of tasks (e.g., payments vs. shipments).
✔ If no queue matches the key, the message is lost (no storage).
